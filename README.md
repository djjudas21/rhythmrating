# RhythmRating

Calculate average album ratings from Rhythmbox metadata

Rhythmbox allows users to rate individual tracks from 1-5 stars. It allows users to sort and filter their collection by track rating. However it does not offer
a way to sort and filter the collection by average album rating.

This is not a Rhythmbox plugin, but just a helper script that can calculate and display average album ratings, to help you make decisions about your music
library.

RhythmRating must be run on the same system that Rhythmbox is installed on. It will automatically locate the Rhythmbox database in `~/.local/share/rhythmbox/rhythmdb.xml`.

## Requirements

This script does not need to be installed and can be run from anywhere on your system. It requires the `XML::Simple` and `Getopt::Long` Perl modules.

On Fedora, these can be installed with:

```sh
sudo dnf install perl-XML-Simple perl-Getopt-Long
```

On Ubuntu, they can be installed with:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libxml-simple-perl
```
