# RhythmRating

Calculate average album ratings from Rhythmbox metadata

Rhythmbox allows users to rate individual tracks from 1-5 stars. It allows users to sort and filter their collection by track rating. However it does not offer
a way to sort and filter the collection by average album rating.

This is not a Rhythmbox plugin, but just a helper script that can calculate and display average album ratings, to help you make decisions about your music
library.
